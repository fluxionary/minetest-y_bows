* [ ] fix drag values for arrows (x_bows does some weird math with the full_punch_interval...)
* [x] damage isn't right (doesn't seem to depend on arrow, seems to be higher for things that're farther away?)
 * i think this was mostly that i had crit wrong
* [x] slingshot
* [x] fire arrow isn't working right
* [x] need to scale damage to some absolute speed and not the arrow's starting speed, to make the wooden things weaker
* [x] if arrow type is changed, force drawing bow again
* [ ] need to ding if you hit the bullseye of the target
