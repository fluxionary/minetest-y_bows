# y_bows

bow and arrow mod using engine collision detection, based on an old version of x_bows.

this mod is primarily intended as a replacement for x_bows on the your-land server, as x_bows has changed a bunch of
things in a way that's incompatible with what's currently in use on your-land. most assets are taken directly from
x_bows, and x_bows items will be aliased to y_bows equivalents unless a setting is toggled.
